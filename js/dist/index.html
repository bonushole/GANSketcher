        <h2>Meet the Team!</h2>
        Maximilian Evans is a senior studying Computer science. He participates in several hackathons a year as well as
        the International Collegiate Programming Contest. His first experience with machine learning was during an
        internship at Onix Networking during his sophomore year. He also interned at VTI Instruments and MIM Software
        and after graduation will work at MIM Software as a full time employee.
        <br>
        <br>
        Jack Perish is a junior majoring in Computer Science. He has participated in a multitude of work and research
        opportunities. Such as working as the primary research assistant to Dr. Zhao and becoming coauthor on his recent
        paper, "Monitoring Activities of Daily Living with a Mobile App and Bluetooth Beacons: A Preliminary Study"
        In addition, he has worked as a software developer for both Medical Mutual and CHAMPtitles.
        <br>
        <br>
        Emily Zhao is a senior Computer Science major. She focuses on frontend development, specifically user interface
        design and user experience. Outside the classroom, she has participated in hackathons where she learned
        libraries and tools such as Adobe Xd, Figma, and React.js. Emily has three internships under her belt:
        IT Development at Medical Mutual, Product Management at KeyBank, and Software Development
        at Progressive Insurance.
        <br>
        <br>
        Valerie Jarvis is a senior Computer Science major with a Mathematics minor. Valerie’s focus has been largely
        centered around frontend development, especially in group projects as well as hackathon events outside of
        classes. She has worked on frontend largely through utilizing top-of-the-line frontend tools and libraries.
        Valerie has had two internships throughout her time in college, one with Nordson in IT and the other with KeyBank in Workforce Management.

        The team would not be complete without Senior Design Advisor Dr. Tianyun Zhang. Dr. Tianyun Zhang received his
      Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Syracuse University in 2021. His research interests include
      model compression on deep neural networks, energy-efficient and high-performance implementations of deep learning
      and artificial intelligence systems, adversarial robustness on artificial intelligence systems, convex and
      non-convex optimization. His research papers have been published in competitive conferences such as ASPLOS,
      ECCV, ICCV, ICDM, DAC, PAKDD, ACC, as well as journal IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems (TNNLS).
